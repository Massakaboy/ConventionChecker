# Convention Checker Concept

### Conventions to check

- Correct position of braces
- Upper/lower case of identifiers
- Class content order: attributes, constructor, methods
- CamelCase identifier
- No return statements in loops

### Method

- Input: Code as a string via terminal scanner
- Decomposition into substrings: methods, classes, identifiers
- One additional class per convention
