# Convention Checker Concept

### Conventions to check


- Correct position of braces (priority 1)
- Upper/lower case of identifiers (priority 1)
- Class content order: attributes, constructor, methods (priority 1)
- No return statements in loops (priority 1)
- CamelCase identifier (priority 2)


### Method

- Input: Code as a string via terminal scanner (end-goal)
- Decomposition into substrings: methods, classes, identifiers (depending on convention needs)
- One additional class per convention
- Unit-Testing
